## User deletion issue

An uptick of reports of users being removed from membership roles led to the discovery of a bug in Gentei that effectively deleted users in the application 8~9 days after registration.

As a result, ~20 users have been errantly deleted (and they've since re-registered), but ***~150 users need to re-link their accounts in Gentei to maintain membership.***

Sorry about that.

### How to tell if you're affected

In the next few days, **gentei-bouncer#9835** will DM you with instructions on what to do, when you need to do it by, and a link back to this page. 

If you do not get this DM, you are not affected.
